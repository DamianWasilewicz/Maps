1. get age = 19; DELETE FROM solider;

since the database is queried using the get command, we used the sql command DELETE FROM to delete from the
table after doing a random (unaffected) query.

2. get age = 19; SELECT COUNT(id) FROM soldier;

returns the number of ids of soliders who are 19 years old.

3. to ensure that SQL injections canâ€™t occur on our own software is to prevent the use of metacharacters exploiting
the database that our program is using. By parsing through the user input and feeding the parsed version of the
input into any querying, it can be protected from malicious users.
